# Deep Learning Model for Scorecard Digit Recognition

## 📌 Project Description
This project focuses on recognizing digits (0-9) from sports scorecards using a deep learning model.  
The model is built using **ResNet18**, trained on digit datasets, and fine-tuned for sports scorecard recognition.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Fine-tuned a **ResNet18 model** for digit recognition  
- ✅ Used **Focal Loss** to address class imbalance  
- ✅ Developed a **batch-processing pipeline** with PyTorch  
- ✅ Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- 🐍 **Python**  
- 🖼 **OpenCV**  
- 🔢 **NumPy**  
- 🔥 **PyTorch**
